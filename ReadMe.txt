This program makes a couple of assumptions:

1). That there's only 1 entry in the user's BCD File (the main OS and no others). Otherwise, the hypervisorlaunchtype detection would need beefing up.
2). It's being used on Windows (not Windows Server). Server has a Hyper-V Role that can be toggled. Maybe down the road that can be added to this program.

NOTE: There's a way to make a "dual boot" w/Hypervisor On/Off as options
See: http://jorgequestforknowledge.wordpress.com/2012/05/26/using-both-microsoft-hyper-v-and-vmware-workstation-on-the-same-machine

Automating the above could also be a feature addition sometime down the road.
