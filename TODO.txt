    TODO: Technically, we could tighten up this code by putting all of the message boxes in their own function, and just calling them, with a result, but it's not high priority right now.
    TODO: Should we add confirmation messageboxes before the user toggles a Hyper-V setting?
    TODO: We SHOULD set a registry flag (MySettings) to know, & alert the user, that a reboot is still pending from a previous toggle, including adding this alert to the lblState label.
          See Time-Since-Reboot code here: http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/scottlysle/determine-the-time-since-the-last-boot-up-in-visual-basic3/
          Idea is: set Last Reboot time as a reg key, Current Time as a reg key, and a "0/1 Pending Reboot" Flag as a reg key, all for comparison purposes.
    TODO: Maybe add some Server 2012 (or whatever) code for toggling off the "Hyper-V Role"? There's no Role in regular Windows that I can tell, which is why I've use the BCDEdit method.

     As of now (1/20/2014 1:43 PM) this app is considered "done", unless someone points out bugs, feature requests, etc.
